# JoyToWake

AutoHotKey script to mute a computer when no inputs are pressed on a controller after some time.

# Motivation

The idea is to make it so music games, especially in public settings such as anime conventions, avoid endlessly looping over the preview audio of the last selected song or the BGM of the result screen after someone is done playing and when no one is immediately going after them. This can cause frustration for the operating staff that will be hearing the same 5 seconds loop over and over for a short period of time.
